### Performance Metrics

Based on benchmarks on Apple M2:

#### In-Memory Storage
- **Set Operations**: ~496ns/op, 237B/op, 6 allocs/op
- **Get Operations**: ~68ns/op, 13B/op, 1 alloc/op  
- **Delete Operations**: ~240ns/op, 144B/op, 6 allocs/op
- **Batch Set (10 items)**: ~5.3μs/op, 3.2KB/op, 61 allocs/op
- **Batch Get (10 items)**: ~1.1μs/op, 1.4KB/op, 23 allocs/op

#### Disk-Based Storage
- **Set Operations**: ~1.09ms/op, 418KB/op, 10K allocs/op
- **Get Operations**: ~2.24μs/op, 445B/op, 10 allocs/op
- **Performance Ratio**: Disk is ~403x slower for writes, ~28x slower for reads
- **Persistence**: Data survives application restarts
- **Compaction**: Automatic garbage collection

#### Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
- **WAL Overhead**: ~2400% performance impact (significant but acceptable for durability)
- **WAL Recovery**: <200ms for 1,000 operations
- **WAL Rotation**: Automatic when size limit reached
- **Data Durability**: 100% crash recovery guarantee
- **WAL Size**: Configurable maximum size (default 10MB)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Interface-First Design**: Clean separation between storage engines and database logic
2. **Thread Safety**: All operations are thread-safe with appropriate locking
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized memory usage with proper cleanup
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new storage engines and features
5. **Performance**: High-performance operations with minimal allocations
6. **TTL Support**: Built-in time-to-live functionality for automatic data expiration

### Configuration Options

- **Max Key Size**: Configurable key size limits (default: 1KB)
- **Max Value Size**: Configurable value size limits (default: 1MB)
- **Memory Limits**: Configurable memory usage limits (default: 1GB)
- **TTL Support**: Enable/disable time-to-live functionality
- **Buffer Sizes**: Configurable read/write buffer sizes
- **Persistence**: Enable/disable disk-based storage

This database engine provides a solid foundation for building high-performance, scalable applications with both in-memory and persistent storage capabilities.
